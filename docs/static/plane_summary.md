# Doing math in the plane

![](../img/plane_t_detail_complex.png)

The real numbers are horizontal, never surprising.

The imaginary number rotate real numbers to be like them.
OR
Real numbers let the imaginary numbers keep going along.

Real times real = real

Imaginary times imaginary = -real because imaginaries rotate imaginaries.

The pair, (real, imaginary) make up the complex plane.
