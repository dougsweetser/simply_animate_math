# Space-time numbers 101 summary

Only three numbers were used in this exercise: 2, 3, and 6.

Only four familiar operations were done:

1. Addition
1. Subtraction
1. Multiplication
1. Division

The results where of three types:

1. Get older
1. Get bigger
1. or Move

These basic operations must be done perfectly right, like they are done by Nature herself.

Professional physicists use math tools that do not consider division to be essential. I view division as just a different relationship between the numbers 2, 3, and 6.

    Division must work, always no exceptions, or I don't understand the numbers 2, 3, and 6.

This simple requirement is subversive. It would demand rewriting nearly every technical physics book in circulation.
