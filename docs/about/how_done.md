# How This Was Done

It all began with studying quaternions for many years...

Then I had a daughter. How could I explain my work to her?

That requires blocks and straws. The blocks were in the house. The huge number 
of straws for the cube cost about $100 from Amazon. While watching "The Big 
Bang Theory" with my wife, I sawed straws and stuck them together.

The photos were taking using a Nexus 5 cell phone mounted on a monopod kept in 
place with a Black & Decker workmate.

Software was written in python to merge the photos together. The project, 
[simply_animate_math](https://github.com/dougsweetser/simply_animate_math), is 
publicly available on github.

This site was generated using **mkdocs**, a great program for a simple static 
site like this one.

The galeries where created using fancyBox from 
[FancyApps](http://fancyapps.com). It is free for non-commercial use such as 
this one, but there is a reasonable licensing fee for commercial sites.  It 
took me a few hours to figure out, and looks gorgeous.
