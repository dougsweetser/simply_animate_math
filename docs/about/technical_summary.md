##Space-time numbers as the new King

Mathematical Physics is written using tensor calculus often over the field of complex numbers.

My own effort is to replace all such work using quaternions, a division algebra born to work with space-time. I now prefer to call quaternions "space-time numbers" because that has a direct meaning in physics. The label "quaternions" was an artifact of history that caries much baggage.

It has been my experience that when someone in the literature has published that real-valued quaternions could not be used for a certain problem, I was able to find an approach that worked. This happened for representing the Lorentz group, for deriving the Maxwell equations, and now I have an invariance principle that may do the work of gravity.

In the future, I hope that an area of study will not be considered complete until the researchers can provide animations.

## The source of probability in quantum mechanics

Once there is some probability in quantum mechanics, so much follows. The riddle is why there should be any? My idea is that in high energy physics, the normal fundamental operations of math - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - become indistinguishable. There is either zero, the vacuum, or unity made up of all possible histories. The quaternion group Q8 describes the properties of space-time numbers.

It is my belief that the standard model of physics will need to be torn down and reconstructed using only the normalized quaternion group. I don't know how to start such a quest, so it will remain a personal belief.
