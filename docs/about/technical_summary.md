# Technical Summary

Mathematical Physics is written using tensor calculus often over the field of complex numbers.

My own effort is to replace all such work using quaternions, a division algebra born to work with space-time.

It has been my experience that when someone in the literature has published that real-valued quaternions could not be used for a certain problem, I was able to find an approach that worked. This happened for representing the Lorentz group, for deriving the Maxwell equations, and now I have an invariance principle that may do the work of gravity.

In the future, I hope that an area of study will not be considered complete until the researchers can provide animations.
