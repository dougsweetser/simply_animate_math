Even today, people can have strong \nopinions about quaternions.  The name in isolation of that history says \"quat\", \nfour.  Other than that, one needs to read up on the subject.\n\n\nSpace-time numbers, as a label, says a bit more.  It is not simply that there \nare four equal partners, but there are the familiar three dimensions of space \nin a tense marriage with scalar time.  Space has properties that are deeply \ndifferent from time, yet with space-time numbers, they never part.  The label \ncan tie directly into the real world by pointing to events there-then, the \n\"there\" being space while \"then\" is the time.\n\n\nFull disclosure: I own quaternions.com so the label quaternions is important to \nme.  I now use both words interchangeably.  Space-time numbers feels more like \na real world term.  Quaternions as a label feels more abstract.  I find it \nhelpful to have both terms in my efforts to understand the accounting system \nused by the Universe.\n\n\nSpace-time numbers as the new King\n\n\nMathematical Physics is written using tensor calculus often over the field of \ncomplex numbers.\n\n\nMy own effort is to replace all such work using quaternions, a division algebra \nborn to work with space-time.\n\n\nIt has been my experience that when someone in the literature has published \nthat real-valued quaternions could not be used for a certain problem, I was \nable to find an approach that worked. This happened for representing the \nLorentz group, for deriving the Maxwell equations, and now I have an invariance \nprinciple that may do the work of gravity.\n\n\nIn the future, I hope that an area of study will not be considered complete \nuntil the researchers can provide animations.\n\n\nThe source of probability in quantum mechanics\n\n\nOnce there is some probability in quantum mechanics, so much follows. The \nriddle is why there should be any? My idea is that in high energy physics, the \nnormal fundamental operations of math - addition, subtraction, multiplication, \nand division - become indistinguishable. There is either zero, the vacuum, or \nunity made up of all possible histories. The quaternion group Q8 describes the \nproperties of space-time numbers.\n\n\nIt is my belief that the standard model of physics will need to be torn down \nand reconstructed using only the normalized quaternion group. I don't know how \nto start such a quest, so it will remain a personal belief.",

My own effort is to replace all such work using quaternions, a division algebra \nborn to work with space-time.  It has been my experience that when someone in the literature has published \nthat real-valued quaternions could not be used for a certain problem, I was \nable to find an approach that worked. This happened for representing the \nLorentz group, for deriving the Maxwell equations, and now I have an invariance \nprinciple that may do the work of gravity.  In the future, I hope that an area of study will not be considered complete \nuntil the researchers can provide animations.",

My idea is that in high energy physics, the \nnormal fundamental operations of math - addition, subtraction, multiplication, \nand division - become indistinguishable. There is either zero, the vacuum, or \nunity made up of all possible histories. The quaternion group Q8 describes the \nproperties of space-time numbers.  It is my belief that the standard model of physics will need to be torn down \nand reconstructed using only the normalized quaternion group.

I view that as my \"born \nagain\" moment, one based on physics, not the Bible. For a month long period, my \nmind kept rearranging information, sure that everything somehow made sense.

I took a \nHarvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he \nwas writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would \nbring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it.\n\nThus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day \njob, but work study physics in the background.\n\n\nI was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked \nat MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was \nI did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I \nhad were a few math widgets.\n\n\nFirst work on quaternions\n\n\nIn the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated \nnewsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief \ndefinition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and \nneeded to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort \nof number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to \nreread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about \nquaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion:\n\n\n\n\nTo this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of \nspecial relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free.\n\nThat cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain \nquaternions.com.\n\n\nMajor failure at a unified field theory\n\n\nI struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions.\n\nOne lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric \ntheory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one \nhappens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric \noperation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a \nhandedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers.\n\nThose have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs \nanywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric.\n\n\nI confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was \ndifficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging \non Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I \nfinally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers \nobjected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the \nproposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from \nquaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve \nangular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will \nchange under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of \nequal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular \nmomentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the \nLagrangian is wrong. End of story.\n\n\nCurrent research\n\n\nWeb sites:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternions.com\n, the mothership of my private\n  research project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers 101\n, a visual introduction to space-time\n  numbers, aka quaternions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement 101\n, a site dedicated to my new proposal \nfor quaternion gravity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualPhysics.org\n has a collection of analytic \n  animations generated with a user-hostile set of tools I wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion space-times-time invariance as gravity\n\n\nI went back to the equation that sparked my initial interest in quaternions:\n\n\n\n\nThe first term is called the interval.

That is a problem because the first term is one of \nthe most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity.\n\nI came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I \nasked a simple question: what if space-times-time was invariant, then what sort \nof physics results? That could be gravity, but a very different theory because \nit is not a field theory.
